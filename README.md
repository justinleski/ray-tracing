# ray-tracing
### Purpose 
The purpoe of this project is to familiarize myself with C++. Coming from a background of C, I have some understanding of how C works but I underestmated the differences. Hence why I think this is an even better project than initially thought.

### Resources
To learn how ray tracing works I've been using:
- Ray Tracing in One Weekend book
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHNewYRvgSk

### Challenges Faced
